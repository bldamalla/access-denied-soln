The solutions to the recently concluded PSHS-Samsung InfoTech Challenge 2018

## Solution
The solution is in the Jupter notebook `Access.ipynb` and the datasets of respective computers are on the `cp_` folders followed by the computer numbers of the participants.

Again, [COMPUTRON][comp] would like to thank you for participating in the competition. We really hope for better project implementations next year (_the final event_).

## Concerns
For concerns regarding the problem, please contact [BonLeif Amalla][bon], since this repository will be unwatched.
